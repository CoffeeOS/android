Getting Started
---------------

To get started with Android/CyanogenMod, you'll need to get
familiar with [Git and Repo](http://source.android.com/source/using-repo.html).

To initialize your local repository using the CyanogenMod trees, use a command like this:

    repo init -u git://github.com/tekcafexos/android.git -b r1.0

Then to sync up:

    repo sync

Please see the [CyanogenMod Wiki](http://wiki.cyanogenmod.org/) for building instructions.
For Vietnamese we will make tutoral in local language on soon.


Buildbot
--------

Currently, we have no public buildbot yet, but all Cyanogenmod supported devices are buildable.
